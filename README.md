## Calculator using HTML, CSS and JS

Calculator made using simple JS application, made in 5 hours total. I'm a backend developer but coding HTML and CSS is relaxing, so I took some time to code this calculator while trying to make it look cool while being efficient and with functions and styles that made it look like a real-life calculator!

### Install Math.js library

```
npm install mathjs
```

## Calculator Layout
